Basic rules for the cursor agent

- Ensure you understand and remember the basic structure of the repository, key dependencies and project structure. 
- Ensure code you generate is consistent with existing coding standards.
- Ensure code you generate is tested by at least one test. Prefer writing E2E tests.
- When writing a large change, ensure README.md is updated to document the change.
- Avoid code duplication as a priority. If any changes introduce code duplication, go the extra mile to suggest solutions that would remove code duplication, even if they require significant refactoring.
- Prefer smaller, single purpose, files over large sprawling files.
- Prefer code that is easily readable. In particular avoid idions such as HTML embedded in code, HTML code generation.
- Avoid generating redundant comments and strongly prefer creating self-describing code. For example if a function name is createUser DO NOT add a comment that says "function to create a user".
